    "## Use of \"frequentist\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, \"frequentist\" is often equated with hypothesis testing based on P-values.\n",
    "However, that's a bit misleading.\n",
    "Fundamentally, there are 2 branches statistics (frequentist and Bayesian), because we have two things we can condition on, the model or the data.\n",
    "For a nice explanation of this grounded in decision theory, check out the first 20 minutes of this lecture by Michael Jordan (no, not \"air\" Jordan, more like \"err\" Jordan):\n",

    "\n",
    "You can approach hypothesis testing from a frequentist or Bayesian approach.\n",
    "We tend to teach the frequentist approach (P-values and confidence intervals) to hypothesis testing, but they are not equivalent.\n",
